Common tags in HTML:

Note: no closing tag
Image tag is self-closing

Hyper links:
<a href = ""> Text displays on webpage</a>
a stands for anchor


td - table data
thead - table head
tbody - table body

forms: place for user to input information
he has a form1.html which contains exaple

input field can associate with data list contries

<New to html5>

CSS - cascading style sheets
- tells browser how to use the html

Don't want to have to update multiple tags for style
-inline styling - changing style tag by tag.
can add it to the head section

How can we apply similar styling accross multimple pages?
- take code and move to new file.

Popular css properties:

Multiple element selectors, use a comments

what if you apply styling to a tag and an id which apply to a single element?
Brings up the problem of specificity
1. inline
2. id
3. class
4. type (tag)

<div id = "foo">
    Hello!
</div>

div {color: blue;}
#foo {color: red;}
--Outcome here is red because the id takes precident

Other selector selectors:

a,b - Multiple element selector
a b descendant selector
a > b child selector
a + b adjacent sibiling selector
[a=b] attribute selector
a:b Pseudoclass selector
a::b Pseudoelement Selector

Responsive design:

- viewport
    - Visual part of screen user can see
    - What happens going from webpage to mobile?
        Can just shrink - not ideal
        Want to adapt..
    add line to change:
    <meta name = "viewport" content = "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    Going to load width to be the device width

- Media Queries
    controling how screens depending on how rendering

rows in boostraps are 12 units long.

How to deal with other types of redundancies?

Sass allows for variables:
sass --watch variables.scss:variables.css <- automatically recompiles file

nest css selectors through sass
ie:
div {
    font-size: 18px;

    p{
        color: blue;
    }

    ul{
        color: green;
    }
}

inheritance
%something <- baseline css
@extend %something; <!-- brings the styling from above into this styling
